The react code is being written entirely with ES6.\\nThere are also some helpers to make dependency injection of angular modules easier.</p>\\n<h2>Why</h2>\\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: May offend your love for angular.js</p>\\n<p>The current angular app is getting a little long in the tooth. Angular.js as a\\nlibrary just doesn’t cut it anymore considering javascript community.</p>\\n<p>Angular has an antiquated module system that doesn’t work well with the commonJS\\ndriven environment of modern javascript. There is also way too much boilerplate\\nand friction when pulling in new libraries. For example, when using any library\\nwith angular you often have to search for special versions of the library that\\nhave <code>angular</code> in the name and have been forked to work with angular’s digest\\ncycle correctly. The sad truth is that many of these libraries just aren’t being\\nmaintained anymore. The truth is that the Javascript community at large is moving\\naway from angular entirely.</p>\\n<p>In our last ‘cross-sync meeting’ we all agreed that we need to move away from\\nangular in the long run. While there’s no consensus on what we should move to,\\nI believe that many developers are counting React out due to misinformation.</p>\\n<p>React is a great library that is easy to understand, is very maintainable and\\nvery flexible. There’s also a vibrant community around it, with tons of third-party\\ncomponents that can be just used</p>\\n<h2>React-bootstrap</h2>\\n<p>React-bootstrap is a collection of bootstrap components re-implemented in React.\\nIt works out of the box with <code>nux.css</code>.</p>\\n<p>React-bootstrap gives us many components that we need to use all over the site.\\nThis includes things like Modal, Popover, Input, Button etc.</p>\\n<p>In angular terms, you can think of these components as having directives for small\\nUI components. You no longer have to think about classNames etc.</p>\\n<h2>Other Components</h2>\\n<p>React-bootstrap covers a lot of ground. But there are still common patterns that\\nwe follow all over the site. Components such as tables, searchable multi-selects\\nand tree-views are all components that we’re building along-side the new code that\\nbe covered in the documentation.</p>\\n\"}\n\n/***/ }\n/******/ ])));\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** bundle.js\n **/"," \t// The module cache\n \tvar installedModules = {};\n\n \t// The require function\n \tfunction __webpack_require__(moduleId) {\n\n \t\t// Check if module is in cache\n \t\tif(installedModules[moduleId])\n \t\t\treturn installedModules[moduleId].exports;\n\n \t\t// Create a new module (and put it into the cache)\n \t\tvar module = installedModules[moduleId] = {\n \t\t\texports: {},\n \t\t\tid: moduleId,\n \t\t\tloaded: false\n \t\t};\n\n \t\t// Execute the module function\n \t\tmodules[moduleId].call(module.exports, module, module.exports, __webpack_require__);\n\n \t\t// Flag the module as loaded\n \t\tmodule.loaded = true;\n\n \t\t// Return the exports of the module\n \t\treturn module.exports;\n \t}\n\n\n \t// expose the modules object (__webpack_modules__)\n \t__webpack_require__.m = modules;\n\n \t// expose the module cache\n \t__webpack_require__.c = installedModules;\n\n \t// __webpack_public_path__\n \t__webpack_require__.p = \"\";\n\n \t// Load entry module and return exports\n \treturn __webpack_require__(0);\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** webpack/bootstrap 1eab99884a5fe7665fb4\n **/","'use strict';\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { 'default': obj }; }\n\nvar _react = require('react');\n\nvar _react2 = _interopRequireDefault(_react);\n\nvar _reactDom = require('react-dom');\n\nvar _reactDom2 = _interopRequireDefault(_reactDom);\n\nvar _reactRouter = require('react-router');\n\nvar _scrollBehaviorLibUseStandardScroll = require('scroll-behavior/lib/useStandardScroll');\n\nvar _scrollBehaviorLibUseStandardScroll2 = _interopRequireDefault(_scrollBehaviorLibUseStandardScroll);\n\nvar _createRoutes = require('create-routes');\n\nvar _createRoutes2 = _interopRequireDefault(_createRoutes);\n\nvar _app = require('app');\n\nvar _app2 = _interopRequireDefault(_app);\n\nvar scrollHistory = (0, _scrollBehaviorLibUseStandardScroll2['default'])(function () {\n  return _reactRouter.browserHistory;\n})();\n\nfunction loadConfig(cb) {\n  var stuff = require('config');\n  if (module.hot) {\n    module.hot.accept(stuff.id, function () {\n      return cb();\n    });\n  }\n  return cb();\n}\n\n_reactRouter.browserHistory.listen(function (location) {\n  if (_app2['default'].onRouteChange) {\n    _app2['default'].onRouteChange(location);\n  }\n});\n\nvar routes = undefined;\nloadConfig(function () {\n  return _app2['default'].loadContext(function (pagesReq) {\n    var _require = require('config');\n\n    var pages = _require.pages;\n\n    if (!routes) {\n      routes = (0, _createRoutes2['default'])(pages, pagesReq);\n    } else {\n      (0, _createRoutes2['default'])(pages, pagesReq);\n    }\n\n    _reactDom2['default'].render(_react2['default'].createElement(_reactRouter.Router, {\n      history: scrollHistory,\n      routes: routes\n    }), typeof window !== 'undefined' ? document.getElementById('react-mount') : void 0);\n  });\n});\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** /usr/local/lib/~/gatsby/dist/utils/web-entry.js\n **/","'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = require('./lib/React');\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ../~/react/react.js\n ** module id = 2\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","/**\n * Copyright 2013-2015, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

The react code is being written entirely with ES6.\\nThere are also some helpers to make dependency injection of angular modules easier.</p>\\n<h2>Why</h2>\\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: May offend your love for angular.js</p>\\n<p>The current angular app is getting a little long in the tooth. Angular.js as a\\nlibrary just doesn’t cut it anymore considering javascript community.</p>\\n<p>Angular has an antiquated module system that doesn’t work well with the commonJS\\ndriven environment of modern javascript. There is also way too much boilerplate\\nand friction when pulling in new libraries. For example, when using any library\\nwith angular you often have to search for special versions of the library that\\nhave <code>angular</code> in the name and have been forked to work with angular’s digest\\ncycle correctly. The sad truth is that many of these libraries just aren’t being\\nmaintained anymore. The truth is that the Javascript community at large is moving\\naway from angular entirely.</p>\\n<p>In our last ‘cross-sync meeting’ we all agreed that we need to move away from\\nangular in the long run. While there’s no consensus on what we should move to,\\nI believe that many developers are counting React out due to misinformation.</p>\\n<p>React is a great library that is easy to understand, is very maintainable and\\nvery flexible. There’s also a vibrant community around it, with tons of third-party\\ncomponents that can be just used</p>\\n<h2>React-bootstrap</h2>\\n<p>React-bootstrap is a collection of bootstrap components re-implemented in React.\\nIt works out of the box with <code>nux.css</code>.</p>\\n<p>React-bootstrap gives us many components that we need to use all over the site.\\nThis includes things like Modal, Popover, Input, Button etc.</p>\\n<p>In angular terms, you can think of these components as having directives for small\\nUI components. You no longer have to think about classNames etc.</p>\\n<h2>Other Components</h2>\\n<p>React-bootstrap covers a lot of ground. But there are still common patterns that\\nwe follow all over the site. Components such as tables, searchable multi-selects\\nand tree-views are all components that we’re building along-side the new code that\\nbe covered in the documentation.</p>\\n\"}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./index.md\n ** module id = 459\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/"],"sourceRoot":""}
